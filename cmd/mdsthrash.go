	Long: `Attempts to create hundreds of small files per second, write tiny amounts to them,
  mass move them to another dir, and later attmpts to unlink files created previously.

  This test is designed around the particulars of the Ceph MDS, in particular, it tries to 
  make the MDS feel as much pain as possible. Many small files will cause MDS trim issues,
  and if iolyzer is run from multiple hosts, it almost guarantees that write capabilities 
  on parent dentries will thrash between hosts constantly.

  Running this test from only one client will not thrash capabilities, and will likely not 
  give any meaningful results.`,
